# ML & DL Basic Practice

## About
Welcome to my Machine Learning and Deep Learning practice repository.
This project records my journey of mastering the core algorithms of AI
Instead of just using libraries, I aim to deeply understand how these models work and how to optimize them for real-world data.

##  Upcoming Plans
I am currently focusing on expanding this repository with a comprehensive set of ML/DL implementations. Here is what I will be working on next:

**1. Mastering Classic ML Algorithms**
* Dive deeper into **Regression** and **Classification** problems.
* Implement **Decision Trees** and apply **Ensemble methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
* Study **Grid Search** and **Cross-Validation** for hyperparameter tuning.

**2. Transitioning to Deep Learning**
* Construct **Neural Networks** from the ground up.
* Implement **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for image recognition tasks.
* Explore **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)** and **LSTMs** for handling time-series and text data.

**3. Advanced Optimization**
* Experiment with various regularization techniques (Dropout, Early Stopping) to improve model performance.
